# The Problem:

While the rocket is on the rail waiting to be launched it will need to be connected to shore power and various data connections (Not my department.). The moment of launch (or as near as we can reasonably get.) this connection needs to be severed in a fail safe way that does not effect the aerodynamic or structural properties of the rocket.
	
# Design Requirements:

* Connector must allow for multiple connections to be passed through the skin of the rocket including power and data connections
* Connection must be rigid but capable of releasing under the initial acceleration of the rocket without binding.
* connector in the detached state must not interfere with the aerodynamics of the rocket flight.

# Design ideas:

Below is an initial design drawing for the umbilical disconnect.

# Bonus points:

Bonus points for sucessful use of electromagnets as a connection method for this device.
